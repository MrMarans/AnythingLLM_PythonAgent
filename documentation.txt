Charts Skill Documentation

The Charts Skill is a Node.js-based agent skill for AnythingLLM that processes data visualization requests and interacts with the backend server to create various types of charts.

System Overview:

The skill is designed to:
1. Receive visualization requests from AnythingLLM
2. Process and validate data
3. Communicate with the backend server
4. Return visualization links

Technical Components:

1. Handler Function
The main component is handler.js which processes requests with parameters:
- type: Chart type (line, bar, scatter, etc.)
- dataset: The data to visualize
- x: X-axis field
- y: Y-axis field
- title: Chart title
- additional: Extra configuration options

2. Data Processing
The system includes:
- JSON parsing for string datasets
- Data validation
- Array type checking
- Support for numbers and date strings

3. Backend Communication
Communicates with the backend server:
- Default backend URL: http://192.168.80.35:8010
- Uses POST requests to /charts/create/
- Handles response status and link generation

Usage Flow:

1. AnythingLLM sends a request with data
2. The skill validates and processes the data
3. A POST request is made to the backend
4. The backend creates the visualization
5. A link to the visualization is returned

Error Handling:

The skill handles various error cases:
- Invalid dataset format
- Network communication errors
- Backend response errors
- Data type validation errors

User Feedback:

The skill provides feedback through introspect messages:
- "Ich schau mir die Daten mal etwas an :)"
- "Ah, ich verstehe die Daten..."
- "Ich habe den Link erzeugt..."
- Error messages when issues occur

Integration:

The skill integrates with:
1. AnythingLLM as an agent skill
2. Backend server for chart creation
3. Frontend visualization system

Deployment Instructions:

1. Transfer files to server:
   scp -r charts_skill/ user@server:/path/to/deployment

2. Install dependencies:
   npm install

3. Configure backend URL if needed in handler.js

4. Deploy with Docker:
   - Use docker-compose down
   - Then docker-compose build
   - Finally docker-compose up

Development Notes:

The skill is designed to be robust with:
- Comprehensive error checking
- Detailed logging
- User-friendly feedback
- Flexible data handling

Security Considerations:

Current implementation includes:
- Basic error handling
- Input validation
- Network error handling

Future improvements could include:
- Authentication
- Rate limiting
- Enhanced security checks

Maintenance:

Regular tasks include:
1. Checking logs
2. Updating dependencies
3. Monitoring error rates
4. Testing with various data types

Common Issues:

1. Data Format Problems
   - Ensure dataset is valid JSON
   - Check array formats
   - Verify date string formats

2. Connection Issues
   - Check backend URL
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check server status

3. Response Handling
   - Monitor response times
   - Check error messages
   - Verify link generation

Future Improvements:

Consider implementing:
1. More chart types
2. Enhanced error reporting
3. Better data validation
4. Caching mechanisms
5. Performance optimization

Note: This skill is part of a larger system and requires the backend server to be operational for full functionality.
